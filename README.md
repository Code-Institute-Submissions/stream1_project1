# Alex Kenny Portfolio Site
## User Centric Front-end Development Milestone Project for the Code Institute
---

The ask of this brief was to build a front-end only website using the technologies learned throughout the User Centric Front-end Development module. I chose to build a portfolio site as I felt it could prove useful in the future, but also to showcase the other projects we would be building as part of the course.

My goal for this project was to demonstrate my understanding of user centric development using the skills I had gleaned in class, and also through further research, whilst also building a site that was visually appealing and told a story of who I am.

A live version of the site can be viewed [here](INSERT LINK), hosted on GitHub Pages.

## UX
---

This site is a static site. Rather than build it as a multi-page site I opted to build a single-page scrolling site with separate page areas. When planning the layout of the site we were learning about relative length units in CSS and I wanted to use what I had learnt about the vertical height unit (vh) to separate the page areas of my single-page site. Therefore, you will see that the header takes up a full screen, the introduction and skills takes up a full screen, the showcase for front-end and back-end takes up a full screen and finally, the re-connect and footer take up a full screen. This effect is demonstrated best on desktop as, due to content amount and variable screen size, mobile has a more fluid scrolling structure. Nonetheless, the site is fully responsive and content size and layout has been appropriately accommodated for mobile, tablet and desktop.

I approached this project methodically, first by understanding whom my eventual audience would be (i.e. course graders and eventually recruiters and employers), secondly by creating low fidelity wireframes and finally, a walking skeleton in code. The result, I feel, is clean legible code, a good responsive layout and easily consumable, visual content.

**No template was used in the building of this site**

Wireframes for this project can be viewed in the wireframes folder above.

User requirements/stories are met in the following way;
- As a recruiter/employer or simply a site visitor, I want to see other sites built by Alex, so I can evaluate his skills. 

The best place to see the other sites I have built is to go to the showcase area for front-end and back-end where you will find links to my other projects.

- As a recruiter/employer, I want a little more detail regarding Alex's project work or employment history, so that I can further research his suitability.

The best place to seek more information on my project work or employment history, is to download the provided PDFs. for either my portfolio, or my cv. These are available through links in the navigation or in the footer section of the site.

- As a recruiter/employer, I want to contact Alex, so that I can discuss opportunities.

The best place to find my contact details is by clicking on the "Say Hello" button in the header or in the re-connect section. By clicking this button, you will open a modal window that contains my phone and email contact details.

## Technologies used
---

- HTML
- -- This project uses HTML for site structure.
- CSS
- -- This project uses CSS for styling.
- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- -- This project uses Bootstrap 4 for additional site structure, styling, but also for interaction and most importantly responsiveness. 
- [Hover CSS](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)
- -- This project uses Hover CSS for minor hover effects, such as the "page scroll" indicator and major hover effects, such as the front-end, back-end text reveal. In the case of the latter, it allowed me to significantly reduce the code I needed if I were to produce this effect otherwise. 
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- -- This project uses Google Fonts for styling.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- -- This project uses Font Awesome for styling.
- [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)
- -- This project uses Coolors for styling.

## Features
---

### Existing Features
- Collapsible navigation - allows users to view downloadable PDFs., on click of burger menu.
- Downloadable portfolio and cv in PDF format - allows users to download PDFs, on click of link and subsequent use of browser native controls.
- Links to other projects - allows users to visit other project sites, on click of link.

### Features left to implement
- Links to social media - allows users to visit related social media sites, on click of link.
- Links to other projects as I finish them - especially the third box in both the front-end and back-end section.


## Testing
---

Cross browser and multi-device testing was employed to test site responsiveness using [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com).

User testing was carried out to ensure;
- All links worked as desired and where required opened in separate tabs.
- All downloadable PDFs worked as desired.
- All hover effects worked as desired, including hidden visibility reversed on mobile.

## Deployment
---

This site is hosted on GitHub pages and is deployed from the master branch.

### Acknowledgements

I would like to acknowledge the following sites I referenced in the research phase of my approach to this project.
- For inspiration for the single-page scrolling layout and grid structure used on my site, I was influenced by what I saw on [JDC Design Studio](http://www.jdcdesignstudio.com/) portfolio site. I also liked the conversational tone of his site.
- For inspiration for the contact modal used on my site, I was influenced by what I saw on [Victoria Spicer](https://vspicer.com/about/) portfolio site. You can see how she used this effect if you click on the "Contact" link on her page. I also liked her bold, but clean introduction paragraph, which I took reference from for mine.
